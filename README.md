# My-first-Github-project-
This is my first Github project, currently learning Python and with the help of "Learning Python the hard way" I've come a long way.
This is a simple command prompt based text editor that I've learned and slightly modified from "Learning Python the hard way".
Example- Python initfile.py init.txt
